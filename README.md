In this side project, I am constructing all of the algorithms listed in Sedgewick and Wayne's 'Algorithms' in Python. 
The algorithms in Sedgewick and Wayne's 'Algorithms' are written in Java. 

My goals for this project are:
1. To increase my understanding of the fundamental data structures and algorithms. 
2. To better understand the underlying mechanisms of object-oriented programing in Python by comparing and contrasting it with Java.
